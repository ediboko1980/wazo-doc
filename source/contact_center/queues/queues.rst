Queues
******

Call queues are used to distribute calls to the agents subscribed to the queue.  Queues are managed on the
:menuselection:`Services --> Call Center --> Queues` page.

   :menuselection:`Services --> Call Center --> Queues --> Add`

A queue can be configured with the following options:

   * Name: used as an unique id, cannot be ``general``
   * Display name: Displayed on the supervisor screen
   * On-Hold music: The music the caller will hear. The music is played when waiting and when the call is on hold.

A ring strategy defines how queue members are called when a call enters the queue.
A queue can use one of the following ring strategies:

   * Linear: For each call, in the same order, starting from the same member

     * For agents: In login order
     * For static members: In definition order

   * Least recent: call the member who least recently hung up a call
   * Fewest calls: call the member with the fewest completed calls
   * Round robin memory: call the "next" member after the one who answered last
   * Random: call a member at random
   * Weight random: same as random, but taking the member penalty into account
   * Ring all: call all members at the same time

   .. warning::

      When editing a queue, you can't change the ring strategy to linear. This
      is due to an asterisk limitation. Unfortunately, if you want to change the
      ring strategy of a queue to linear, you'll have to delete it first and then
      create a new queue with the right strategy.

  .. note::

     When an agent is a member of many queues the order of call distribution
     between multiple queues is nondeterministic and cannot be configured.


Timers
======

You may control how long a call will stay in a queue using different timers:

   * Member reachabillity time out (Advanced tab): Maximum number of seconds a call will ring on an agent's phone. If a call is not answered within this time, the call will be forwarded to another agent.
   * Time before retrying a call to a member (Advanced tab): Used once a call has reached the "Member reachability time out". The call will be put on hold for the number of seconds alloted before being redirected to another agent.
   * Ringing time (Application tab): The total time the call will stay in the queue.
   * Timeout priority (Application tab): Determines which timeout to use before ending a call. When set to "configuration", the call will use the "Member reachability time out". When set to "dialplan", the call will use the "Ringing time".

No Answer
=========

Calls can be diverted on no answer:

.. figure:: noanswer.png
    :scale: 85%

* No answer: The call reached the "Ringing time" in Application tab and no agent answered the call
* Congestion: The number of calls waiting has reached the "Maximum number of people allowed to wait" limit specified on the advanced tab
* Fail: No agent was available to answer the call when the call entered the queue ("Join an empty queue" condition on the advanced tab) or
  the call was queued and no agents were available to answer ("Remove callers if there are no agents" on the advanced tab)


Diversions
==========

Diversions can be used to redirect calls to another destination when a queue is very busy.
Calls are redirected using one of the two following scenarios:

.. figure:: diversions.png
    :scale: 85%

The diversion check is done only once per call, before the :ref:`preprocess subroutine <subroutine>` is
executed and before the call enters the queue.

In the following sections, a waiting call is a call that has entered the queue but has not yet been
answered by a queue member.


Estimated Wait Time Overrun
---------------------------

When this scenario is used, the administrator can set a destination for calls to be sent to when the estimated waiting time is over the threshold.

Note that if a new call arrives when there are no waiting calls in the queue, the call will **always** be allowed to enter the queue.

.. note:: 
  
  * this *estimated* waiting time is computed from the **actual hold time** of all **answered** calls in the queue 
    (since last asterisk restart) according to an `exponential smoothing formula <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing>`_
  * the estimated waiting time of a queue is updated only when a queue member answers a call.

Number of Waiting Calls per Logged-In Agent Overrun
---------------------------------------------------

When this scenario is used, the administrator can set a destination for calls to be sent to when the number of waiting
calls per logged-in agent is over the threshold.

The number of waiting calls includes the call for which the check is currently being performed.

The number of logged-in agents is the sum of user members and currently logged-in agent members. An
agent only needs to be logged in and a member of the queue to participate towards the count of logged-in agents,
regardless of whether he is available, on call, on pause or on wrapup.

The maximum number of waiting calls per logged-in agent can have a fractional part.

Here are a few examples::

    Maximum number of waiting calls per logged-in agent: 1
    Current number of waiting calls: 2
    Current number of logged-in agents: 2
    Number of waiting calls per logged-in agent when a new call arrives: 3 / 2 = 1.5
    Call will be redirected

    Maximum number of waiting calls per logged-in agent: 0.5
    Number of waiting calls: 5
    Number of logged-in agents: 12
    Number of waiting calls per logged-in agent when a new call arrives: 6 / 12 = 0.5
    Call will not be redirected

Note that if a new call arrives when there are no waiting calls in the queue, the call will
**always** be allowed to enter the queue.  For example, in the following scenario::

    Maximum number of waiting calls per logged-in agent: 0.5
    Current number of waiting calls: 0
    Current number of logged-in agents: 1
    Number of waiting calls per logged-in agent when a new call arrives: 1 / 1 = 1

Even if the number of waiting calls per logged-in agent (1) is greater than the maximum (0.5), the call
will still be accepted since there are currently no waiting calls.


Music on Hold
=============

The music on hold of the queue will be played:

* When the caller is waiting to be answered.
* When the caller is put on hold by an agent who already answered.

If you want a different music to be played when the caller is put on hold after being answered, you need to make some more configuration:

#. Write an AGI script that will set the channel variable ``CHANNEL(musicclass)`` to the name of the music-on-hold class you want the caller to hear when he is put on hold by the agent. Save this script to e.g. ``/usr/local/bin/agi-agent-hold-moh``.
#. Add the following :ref:`preprocess subroutine <subroutine>` on the queue::

    [setup-agent-hold-moh]
    exten = s,1,NoOp(Setting AGI script for custom agent hold music)
    same  =   n,Set(XIVO_QUEUEAGI=/usr/local/bin/agi-agent-hold-moh)
    same  =   n,Return

This configuration will give the following scenario:

* The caller calls the queue
* The caller hears the music on hold of the queue
* The agent answers the call
* Wazo calls the AGI script, setting the new music on hold
* The caller and the agent talk together
* The agent puts the caller on hold
* The caller hears the new music on hold, set by the AGI script
