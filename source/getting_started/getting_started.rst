This section will show you how to create a user with a SIP line. This simple use case covers what a lot of people need to start using a phone.
You can use these steps for configuring a phone (e.g  a softphone, an Analog-to-Digital switch or a SIP phone).

This tutorial doesn't cover how to automatically provision a :ref:`supported device
<supported-devices>`. For this, consult the :ref:`provisioning
section. <intro-provisioning>`

We first need to log into the Wazo web interface. The web interface is where you can administer the whole system.

   Logging into the Wazo

When logged in, you will see a page with all the status information about your system.
This page helps you monitor the health of your system and gives you information about your network. Please note the IP address of your server,
you will need this information later on when you will configure your device (e.g. phone)
